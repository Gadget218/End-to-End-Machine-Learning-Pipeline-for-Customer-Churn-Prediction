# End-to-End-Machine-Learning-Pipeline-for-Customer-Churn-Prediction

Designed an Airflow pipeline for preprocessing and periodic model retraining using scikit-learn and MLflow. 

Deployed the model as a REST API with FastAPI for real-time predictions.

Monitored performance with live metrics and implemented data drift detection to ensure accuracy. (Utilized a Docker container to run all the processes)
